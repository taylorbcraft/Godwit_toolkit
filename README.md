# Godwit Toolkit
 
**R Shiny Apps**

1.) Flyway Tracking Summary

Visualizes godwit movements across Europe and Africa, allowing users to define areas of interest (AOIs), filter by date or tagging site, and generate visit statistics and time-series plots.

2.) Friesland GPI Viewer

Examines habitat use in Dutch breeding grounds, linking godwit locations to Grassland Production Intensity (GPI) derived from Sentinel-2 imagery.

3.) Do√±ana Wetland Viewer

Analyzes spring stopover use in southern Spain. Classifies each location as flooded or dry based on monthly SWIR1 composite rasters.

4.) Senegal Delta Habitat Use

Summarizes habitat use in the Senegal River Delta, using land cover classifications and seasonal filters to explore habitat preferences during the non-breeding season.
